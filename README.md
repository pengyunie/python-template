# TODO_project_name

To use this template:
- replace all `TODO_...` with appropriate values
  - `TODO_pkg_name` is the name of the Python package, should only contain lower case letters, numbers, and `_` (and preferably no `_` at all); don't forget to rename the `src/TODO_pkg_name` directory
- check all comments start with `TODO:` and take actions
- test your install:
  - `./prepare-env.sh`
  - `conda activate TODO_pkg_name`
  - `pytest`
- delete `example_*.py` files and this README's content, and start developing your code
